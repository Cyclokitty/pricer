This coding exercise sent me down a rabbit's hole about just what is a javascript library and how to make one.

By the end of my research, I published a simple cat-namer library in npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cat-namer) and knew how I wanted to make my pricer library.

I was worried that not building a web page with plenty of buttons and a form would not describe my abilities. Instead, I found out how to write code and documentation for other programmers to use in their own coding projects. I enjoyed this very much.

The library is very simple: a user includes information from the client in the function call and receives back a statement with the complete price.

My pricer exercise was also the first time I used testing and I am impressed with the fast and conclusive results. My future includes writing better tests for my code.

As far as design choices, I did at first think of using the command line with args to implement the pricer. That way the user could input:

  $ ./pricer.js --cost 1299.99 --persons 3 materials food
  Output: $1591.58

Perhaps with a text file where prices can be recorded for later review. I still may try that using Yargs (https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs).

Thank you for this internship opportunity and I am looking forward to your review of my coding exercise.
